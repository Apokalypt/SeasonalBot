# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discussions](https://github.com/Apokalypt/SeasonalBot/discussions) tab instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the project codebase, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. 
We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice is a great boon 
to your development process.

## Setup

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **main** branch
2. Run `npm install`
3. Code what you want!
4. Run `npm test` to run ESLint and ensure any TSDoc changes are valid
5. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/Apokalypt/SeasonalBot/compare)
